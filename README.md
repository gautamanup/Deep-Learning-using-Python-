# CSC-424
First , we need to set up a Virtual Environment using Anaconda. I did my virtual environment setup by initializing Python version as Python == 3.5
and installed the following libraries :
tensorflow == 1.8
tf-learn
numpy 
scikit-image 
If the program complains about missing further libraries , you can always pip install it. 

Run the program by the command :
python demo.py --image Data/examples/plane.png

 Output mesh file is saved in Data/examples/plane.obj
